# Project context (optional)
# This is shown to AI when creating artifacts.
# Add your tech stack, conventions, style guides, domain knowledge, etc.
# Example:
#   context: |
#     Tech stack: TypeScript, React, Node.js
#     We use conventional commits
#     Domain: e-commerce platform

# Per-artifact rules (optional)
# Add custom rules for specific artifacts.
# Example:
#   rules:
#     proposal:
#       - Keep proposals under 500 words
#       - Always include a "Non-goals" section
#     tasks:
#       - Break tasks into chunks of max 2 hours

  Always include 'project.md'
  ### Workflow
  * Prioritize code correctness and clarity. Speed and efficiency are secondary priorities unless otherwise specified.
  * Write short, clear, and concise code.
  * Use functional paradigms for code organization.
  * Ask clarifying questions if input is unclear.
  * Modularize by concern, not by technical layer
  * One responsibility per module
  * Low inter-module coupling
  * Short functions, no overengineering
  * Apply Four Rules of Simple Design:
    1. Code works (passes tests)
    2. Reveals intent
    3. No duplication
    4. Minimal elements
  * Prefer functional style:
    * Use explicit parameters
    * Prefer immutability
    * Prefer declarative over imperative
    * Minimize state
  ### Commit Strategy
   * One prompt = one commit
   * Each commit:
     * Self-contained
     * Includes tests
     * Uses 50/70 commit message format
